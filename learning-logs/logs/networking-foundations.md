# Networking Basics

Networking is the foundation of how computers communicate with each other.

- **IP Address:** Unique identifier for devices.
- **DNS:** Converts website names into IP addresses.
- **Router vs Switch:** Router connects different networks; switch connects devices within a network.

Networking knowledge is critical for IT roles.  
Iâ€™m strengthening my basics by practicing subnetting, studying OSI model layers, and setting up small networks at home.
