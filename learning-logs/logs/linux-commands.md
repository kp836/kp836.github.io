# Linux Commands Every IT Person Should Know

Learning Linux is important for any IT professional.

Some commands I'm practicing:
- `ls`: List files
- `cd`: Change directory
- `pwd`: Show current directory
- `sudo`: Run a command with admin privileges
- `chmod`: Change file permissions

Working with Linux command-line sharpens problem-solving skills and system understanding.
