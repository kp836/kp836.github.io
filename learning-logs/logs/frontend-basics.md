# Frontend Tips for Beginners

Frontend development is about creating beautiful, functional user interfaces.

**Key tips:**
- Focus on **HTML structure** first.
- Use **CSS Flexbox and Grid** to control layout.
- Make websites **responsive** early, not as an afterthought.
- **JavaScript** should enhance, not control everything.

Iâ€™m also practicing building small components like navbar, card layouts, and responsive forms.
